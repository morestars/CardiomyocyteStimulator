# H-bridge Circuit

The H-bridge circuit serves to gate the high voltage stimulation with a low voltage TTL signal and allows for bidirectional stimulation at the electrodes.

The circuit is mirrored across the center line of the breadboard.  Pins 7 should be connected to the stimulation electrodes.  Pins XX (bottom-most) should be connected to the low-voltage TTL source.
