# LED Mount

The LED mount needs to hold the LED over the objective in order to signal the onset of a stimulation.  Make sure that the mount is placed over components that do not move with the Lumascope stage if multiple wells need to be stimulated.  Place the LED directly over the sample, facing downwards, and verify that a nearly all white signal is present manually in the Lumascope.  Adjust the LED placement manually while the LED is powered on in a steady state.  The DC power supply can be used for this setup with the the voltage set to 2-3 V.
