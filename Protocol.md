# Protocol

#### A barebones protocol.  Read through the specific components to get a better understanding of the procedure.

1. Place coverslip in the center of a 35mm dish with 3mL of media.  Use an additional slip to surround the coverslip if there is excess motion.
2. Put carbon electrodes in the 35mm dish parallel to one another.
3. Move the 35mm dish with electrodes into the Lumascope chamber.
4. Move the Lumascope stage to the region of interest and focus.
5. Mount the LED above the 35mm dish.  Power the LED and use the Lumascope to find an appropriate location for the LED.
6. Set the DC power supply to 10% above the minimum capture voltage (~ 7V).  Do not turn on the supply voltage yet.
7. Attach the stimulation wires to the electrodes and connect the LED to the stimulation system, as well.
8. Set the protocal settings in the Lumaview software to match with the timing and stimulation control of the microcontroller.
9. Turn on or reset the microcontroller.
10. Turn on the DC power supply current.
11. Begin the Lumaview protocol directly following the end of the 10 LED flashes.
12. Repeat recordings as necessary for a given sample.
