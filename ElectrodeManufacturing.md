# How to manufacture the electrodes

The carbon electrodes are the interface between the cell media and the electrical wiring for field stimulation.  They must be sterilizable and biocompatible with the cells.

## Materials
* Carbon rods
  * 0.12" diameter
  * 1" length per electrode (2 are requried for field stimulaiton)
  * https://www.laddresearch.com/vacuum-equipment/digital-high-vacuum-system-accessories/graphite-carbon-rods
* Platinum wire
  * '>= 99% purity
  * 0.016" diameter
  * LENGTH?
* Solder
* Bare copper wire (solid jumper wire)

## Instructions
1. Cut the carbon rods to size
  * You can use a bandsaw, thin hacksaw, or exacto knife.  When using an exacto knife, provide gentle pressure and roll the carbon rod back and forth under it.
2. Drill a radial hole through the carbon rod (perpendicular to the length of the carbon rod).  Size the whole for minimal clearance with the platinum wire.
  * Carbon is easily drilled through.  A drillbit can be attached to the exacto mounts and manually twisted to drill through the carbon rods.
  * Alternatively, use a hand drill or mill.
3. Inser the platinum wire through the carbon rod, flush with the other side or slighlty less than flush.
4. Twist the carbon rod while holding the platinum wire in order to wrap the platinum wire around the carbon rod 180-360 degrees.
  * The wrap should hold the carbon rod firmly in the platinum wire without causing too much pressure on the carbon rod itself.
  * This will make the electrical contact from platinum wire to carbon rod while also holding the two together.
5. Solder an extended section of bare copper wire to the free end of the platinum wire.
  * Provide enough overlap to ensure connectivity and stability.
  * Do not form a but joint, solding onldy the tips of the two wires.
6. Place the carbon rod in a 35mm dish and bend the platinum wires over the edge of the dish to secure its position.  Do not bend too much, as the carbon rods will still need to be transfered later to the 35mm dish being used for the cells.
7. Connect the copper wires to female-female jumper cables.
8. Repeat for a second electrode to form a field stimulation.
9. It will be easiest to leave the female-female jumper cables on the platinum wires when transitiong the setup.  This connection is more difficult to replace when imaging.
